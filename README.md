# Student-Assistance
This is an web app for assisting student in storing their notes making, generating quizzes, add goals and checking their progress as well

# This is built mainly using Python only
I have used multiple libraries such as sqlite3, contextlib, pathlib, hashlib, secrets, datetime. The UI was built using streamlit.
